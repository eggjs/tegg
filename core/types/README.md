# `@eggjs/tegg-types`

## why

Not all types and enums are suitable to be exported by tegg, but some types and enums are useful for tegg plugin and application development.

So we need this package to provide shared types and enums for tegg.

## content

shared types (type and interface) and enums for tegg, including:

- shared types and enums among multiple tegg core packages

- shared types and enums provided for tegg plugin and application development
